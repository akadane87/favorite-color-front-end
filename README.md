An Explanation:
*  This application is a GREAT example of how to meet requirements when your back is up against the wall. They say "3rd times the charm" and this was my 3rd attempt at a full stack application. While my pet project is still in Beta I've created "What's Your Favorite Color (sarcastic emoji) designed for for users to CRUD their favorite (or any) colors"
