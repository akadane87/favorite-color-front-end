An Explanation:
*  This application is a GREAT example of how to meet requirements when your back is up against the wall. They say "3rd times the charm" and this was my 3rd attempt at a full stack application. While my pet project is still in Beta I've created "What's Your Favorite Color (sarcastic emoji) is designed for users to CRUD their favorite (or any) colors. The app works by a user first signing up/in and then post all of their favorite colors yayy! Then they are able to display all of the colors and either change them or delete them if they change their minds. Each user's list of favorite color belongs only to them.
